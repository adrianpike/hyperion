== Some words on Hyperion Migration ==

Occasionally we'll have to re-architect some of the ways that Hyperion stores data, keys, or indices. This will sometimes make your existing database incompatible with new versions of Hyperion. While in the long-term, we plan on making the migration a seamless experience, for now we'll try to document the low-level changes here, as well as how to manually migrate your database(s).

== 0.1.* -> 0.2.* ==

Indexes were changed from SETs to ZSETs so we could do range queries. All tables will require a reindexing.
Foo.reindex! should do the trick. (untested as of this writing, can some others verify on a backup?)
