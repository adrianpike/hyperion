_We're not here yet, I'm still workin on it! :]_

Lots of things were revised for this version, specifically around indexing and finding. 
*The old .find style of finders is no more* - where before you would have used Object.find(:cond_1 => 'foo', :cond_2 => 'bar'), now you have to use Object.find(:all, :conditions => {:cond_1 => 'foo', :cond_2 => 'bar'}). There's also lots more stuff around ordering and limiting your sorts, and you can do greater than and less then matching for queries. Check out finders.rb for the full scoop.
The database is now incompatible, and has a method for checking database compatibility. Look for a migration tool shortly.

 * New finders, for partial matches, ordering, and result set limiting.
 * Indexes now use zsets.
 * ActiveModel::Validations and ActiveModel::Callbacks are now used if ActiveModel is around.
 * DB versioning stub
